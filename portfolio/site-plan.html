      <h3>About</h3>
      <p>
        3.	About:
            a.	Hi, My name is Anya!<br>
                i.	I’ve been working as a web and graphic designer for the past couple years, and I’m passionate about creating visually appealing and user-friendly experiences. When I’m not designing, I love to curl up with a good book or hit the pavement for a run. I also find myself constantly tinkering with code, which I guess you could say is a bit of a programmer’s curse (but in a good way!). I love to learn and always find myself diving into whatever my new project is.<br>
            b.	Frequently Asked Questions<br>
                i.	Will I be able to update the website myself?<br>
                    1.	Yes! We primarily use WordPress which allow you to easily update your website’s content without needing any coding knowledge, including changing pictures, adding blog posts, and updating content. If you have any questions feel free to reach out to us.<br>
                ii.	I want _ feature in my site, can you do that?<br>
                    1.	Probably. There are so many things that we can easily add to your website. If we do not currently know how to do what you want, we are always willing to learn and try new things<br>
                iii.	How much does a website cost?<br>
                    1.	This is a common question with no one-size-fits-all answer. Web design costs can vary depending on the complexity of the website, the features you need, and if you would like us to upkeep the website for you.<br>
