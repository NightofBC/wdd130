                <h2>Hi, My name is Anya!</h2>
                <p class="about-text">I’ve been working as a web and graphic designer for the past year, and I’m passionate about creating visually appealing and user-friendly experiences. When I’m not designing, I love to curl up with a good book or hit the pavement for a run. I also find myself constantly tinkering with code, which I guess you could say is a bit of a programmer’s curse (but in a good way!). I love to learn and always find myself diving into whatever my new project is.

                <h3>How much does a website cost?</h3>
                <p class="about-text">This is a common question with no one-size-fits-all answer. Web design costs can vary depending on the complexity of the website, the features you need, and if you would like us to upkeep the website for you.</p>
